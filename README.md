# AI
This is a small project I worked on during my studies at Full Sail University.

It is more of a collection of small assignments I worked on related to AI behaviors and various algorithms involved in that. I know it's kind of just a dump of stuff and I apologize. It's purpose is simply to archive the fact that I did it. This repository will not include any releases, the behaviors are designed to run within a shell program created by the school which I did not have any part in developing. This is merely a showcase of the work I did.
